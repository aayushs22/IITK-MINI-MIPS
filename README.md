### IITK‑MINI‑MIPS  
*Course Project — CS220: Computer Architecture*  
Supervisor: **Prof. Debapriya Basu Roy**, Department of CSE, IIT Kanpur  

- **Designed** a 32‑bit single‑cycle processor with a custom instruction set using **Verilog HDL**.  
- Supported **50 + instructions** covering branches, arithmetic, jumps, loads/stores, and immediate operations.  
- Implemented instruction encoding for **R‑, I‑, and J‑type** formats, an **ALU**, control FSM, and memory architecture.  
- Executed the full pipeline (fetch → decode → execute → branch) and validated functionality with a **MIPS‑based bubble‑sort** program.  
- Developed a **Python‑based assembler** to translate MIPS‑style assembly into machine code.
