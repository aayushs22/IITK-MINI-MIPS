# IITK-MINI-MIPS

Course Project for CS220: Computer Architecture - under Prof. Debapriya Basu Roy, Dept. of CSE, IITK.

• Designed a 32-bit single-cycle processor with custom instruction set using Verilog Hardware Description Language
• Processor supports over 50 instructions: including branches, arithmetic, jumps, loads,stores and immediate types.
• Implemented instruction encoding for R-, I-, and J-type formats, ALU, control FSM, and memory architecture.
• Executed complete pipeline: fetch, decode, execute, branching; validated with MIPS-based Bubble Sort.
• Made a Python- based assembler to convert the MIPS- style instructions to machine code.
